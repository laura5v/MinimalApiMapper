## Features

- **MVC-like Organization**: Structure your Minimal APIs like traditional MVC applications.
- **Native AOT Support**: Enjoy the benefits of Ahead-of-Time compilation for better performance.
- **Source Generation**: Automatically generate code to reduce boilerplate and improve productivity.
- **Dependency Injection**: Seamlessly integrate with ASP.NET Core's built-in dependency injection.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Enhance your APIs with native performance improvements.

## Getting Started

To start using MinimalApiMapper, you can download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/laura5v/MinimalApiMapper/releases). After downloading, execute the necessary files to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or higher)
- An IDE or text editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code)

## Installation

You can install MinimalApiMapper via NuGet. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet add package MinimalApiMapper
```

Alternatively, you can download the package directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/laura5v/MinimalApiMapper/releases) section.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example to help you get started:

1. **Create a new ASP.NET Core project**:

   ```bash
   dotnet new web -n MyMinimalApi
   cd MyMinimalApi
   ```

2. **Add MinimalApiMapper**:

   ```bash
   dotnet add package MinimalApiMapper
   ```

3. **Configure your API**:

   Open `Program.cs` and set up your Minimal APIs using the mapper.

   ```csharp
   using MinimalApiMapper;

   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   var app = builder.Build();

   app.MapGet("/api/hello", () => "Hello, World!");

   app.Run();
   ```

4. **Run your application**:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Access your API**:

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/hello`. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed.

## Advanced Configuration

MinimalApiMapper allows for more advanced configurations. You can customize your routing, middleware, and dependency injection setup. 

### Custom Routes

To create custom routes, simply define them in your `Program.cs`:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/api/greet/{name}", (string name) => $"Hello, {name}!");
```

### Middleware Integration

You can add middleware to your application as follows:

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    // Do something before the next middleware
    await next.Invoke();
    // Do something after the next middleware
});
```
